			<p>Whether you know it or not, you've like learned all of your math in base 10, also known as a decimal number system. Humans initally started counting in this becasue we had 10 fingers, so it made sense to count on our fingers. But it isn't the only number system. Computers count in base 2, or binary. This is because they use transistors to store information, which only have to states: on or off. This is represented as a 0 or a 1. </p>
			<p>Thankfully counting in base 2 isn't much harder than counting in base 10. In base 10, you go 1, 2, 3, etc. utill eventually you reach 9. We have no more single digits after 9, so we then add a new 1 in front of it and reset the first digit back to 0, making 10. We do the same in binary, but instead of counting up 9, we only count to 1 before we have to add another digit in front of the first digit. So 0 is 0, 1 is 1, but then 2 is 10 because we have reach the maximimum digit in base 2.</p>
