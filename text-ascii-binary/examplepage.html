    <p>Computers speak different languages than humans: in order to make sure computers stored alpha-numeric characters the same across systems, they created a universal standard code called the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (or ASCII for short). In ASCII, A = 65 and B = 66 and so on and so forth. However, on a hardware level, computers store values either as "on" or "off" through transistors. This is represented as a 1 or a 0. In binary you can string 1s and 0s together, which make bytes (typically 8 digits). With 8-digit bytes you can store up to 256 different values, such as the ASCII codes for English.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, take the first step that every computer scientist takes on their digital journey and type "hello world" into the textbox below. You will see what your computers translates from binary, into ASCII, and finally English for all digital text.</p>
